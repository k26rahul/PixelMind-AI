# PixelMind-AI: Automatic Image Color Enhancement
This repository contains my solution for the PixelMind AI Hackathon, which aims to develop a model or algorithm capable of automatically enhancing the colors of raw images, similar to the results achieved by professionals using Adobe Lightroom and/or Adobe Photoshop.

## Problem Statement
Photography is an art form that captures the beauty of the world around us. However, raw images taken by DSLR cameras may not accurately represent the vibrancy and colors of the original scene. Manual color correction using specialized tools can be time-consuming and requires expertise. The goal of this hackathon is to create an efficient and accurate solution that can automatically enhance the colors of raw images.

## Dataset
The training dataset provided consists of pairs of images: 'before' images, which are raw images straight out of a DSLR camera, and 'after' images, which are the same images color-corrected by professionals using Adobe Lightroom and/or Adobe Photoshop. The test dataset contains only 'before' images, and the performance of the model will be evaluated based on its ability to enhance the colors in these images.
