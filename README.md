# PixelMind-AI: Automatic Image Color Enhancement

Solution for the PixelMind AI Hackathon, May 2023.

## Problem

Raw DSLR images often lack the vibrancy of the original scene. Manual color correction is time-consuming. The goal was to create a model to automatically enhance colors like Lightroom/Photoshop.

## Dataset

- **Training:** Pairs of 'before' (raw) and 'after' (professionally color-corrected) images.
- **Test:** Only 'before' images. Model performance is measured on color enhancement.

## Note

No code solution was developed. This repo contains only learning notes and ideas from when I was new to hackathons. Uploaded for historical purposes; nothing functional is included.
